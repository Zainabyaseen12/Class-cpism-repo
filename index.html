    <h1 style="background-color: black;color: white;text-align: center;font-size: larger;">HTML</h1>
    <h2 style="background-color: black;color: white;text-align: center;font-size: large;">DEFINITION</h2>
    <p style="color: black;text-align: justify;">HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML is the standard markup language
    for creating Web pages. HTML describes the structure of a Web.
    HTML consists of a series of elements.HTML elements tell the browser 
    how to display the content.</P>
    <h3 style="background-color: black;color: white;text-align: center;font-size: large;">USAGE OF HTML</h3>
    <p style="color: black;text-align: justify;">HTML is used to create webpages but does experience limitations when it comes to fully responsive components. Therefore, HTML should only be used to add text elements and structure them within a page. For more complex features, HTML can be combined with cascading style sheets (CSS) and JavaScript (JS).</p>
    <h4  style="background-color: black;color: white;text-align: center;font-size: large;">DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TAG AND ELEMENT</h4>
    <p style="color: black;text-align: justify;" >Tag: A tag is the markup used to create an element. Tags are the building blocks of HTML and come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. For example, in <p>Hello, world!</p>, <p> is the opening tag and </p> is the closing tag.
    Element: An element refers to the complete structure that includes the opening tag, closing tag, and the content in between. Using the previous example, <p>Hello, world!</p> is the paragraph element. It represents the entire paragraph as a single entity.</p>
<h5 style="background-color: black;color: white;text-align: center;font-size: large;"> ATTRIBUTES AND ENTITIES </h5>
<p style="color: black;text-align: justify;">In HTML, attributes provide additional information about elements and are specified within the opening tag as name/value pairs, like href="https://example.com" in an anchor tag. Common attributes include class, id, and style. On the other hand, entities are special codes used to represent characters that have a specific meaning in HTML or are not easily typed, such as &nbsp; for a non-breaking space and &lt; for the less-than sign. Together, attributes and entities enhance the functionality and readability of HTML documents.

<h6 style="background-color: black;color: white;text-align: center;font-size: large;">TYPES OF ATTRIBUTES</h6>
<p style="color: black;text-align: justify;">HTML attributes can be categorized into several types based on their function. Global attributes like id, class, and style apply to any element, providing unique identifiers or styling. Event attributes such as onclick and onmouseover trigger JavaScript functions in response to user actions. Form attributes like action and method define form submission behavior, while media attributes (e.g., src and alt) enhance the functionality of images and audio/video elements. Lastly, link attributes in anchor tags, such as href and target, specify the URL and how it opens. Together, these attributes enhance the interactivity and functionality of web pages.</p>
